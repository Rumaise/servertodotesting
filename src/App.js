          Learn Rumaise reactjs he Batman is a 2022 American superhero film
          based on the DC Comics character Batman. Produced by Warner Bros.
          Pictures, DC Films, 6th & Idaho, and Dylan Clark Productions, and
          distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, it is a reboot of the Batman
          film franchise. The film was directed by Matt Reeves, who wrote the
          screenplay with Peter Craig. It stars Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne
          / Batman alongside Zoë Kravitz, Paul Dano, Jeffrey Wright, John
          Turturro, Peter Sarsgaard, Andy Serkis, and Colin Farrell. The film
          sees Batman, who has been fighting crime in Gotham City for two years,
          uncover corruption while pursuing the Riddler (Dano), a serial killer
          who targets Gotham's elite. Development began after Ben Affleck was
          cast as Batman in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) in 2013. Affleck
          signed on to direct, produce, co-write, and star in The Batman, but
          had reservations about the project and dropped out. Reeves took over
          and reworked the story, removing the DCEU connections. He sought to
          explore Batman's detective side more than previous films, drawing
          inspiration from the films of Alfred Hitchcock and the New Hollywood
          era, and comics such as Year One (1987), The Long Halloween (1996–97),
          and Ego (2000). Pattinson was cast in May 2019, with further casting
          in late 2019. Principal photography took place in the UK and Chicago
          between January 2020 and March 2021. The Batman premiered at Lincoln
          Center, New York, on March 1, 2022, and was theatrically released
          worldwide on March 4. It was delayed twice from an initial June 2021
          release date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film has grossed over
          $764 million against a $185–200 million budget, making it the
          highest-grossing film of 2022, and received praise for the
          performances, cinematography, Reeves' direction, action sequences, and
          story, though some criticized its runtime. It is intended to launch a
          Batman shared universe, with two sequels planned and two spin-off
          television series in development for HBO Max.
